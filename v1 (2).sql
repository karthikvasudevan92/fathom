After airbags, you now get in a car wreck and are just injured or maimed.\n\nImprovements in medical care prevent premature deaths, resulting in a HUGE increase in a sick and disabled population.\n\nSo the population mentioned in the article that used to enjoy a long and healthy retirement, is still there in today\'s population. There\'s just an added subsection of disabled individuals, who would have died at the onset of their disease in past generations.\n\nJust in the last 15 years there been a 38% increase in the number of individuals making claims for social security durability: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/dibStat.html', 1, 'dp9wcmf', '6073'),

The cohorts with higher normal retirement ages are now about 60–70—approaching the ages when most Americans retire.\n\n >The findings of our study are consistent with recent evidence indicating that the health of Americans in their 50s and early 60s has not improved over the past two decades6 and may, in fact, have worsened.7,8 A study by Anne Case and Angus Deaton found that morbidity and mortality increased between 1997 and 2013 for non-Hispanic whites ages 45–54.9 These recent trends follow a period of significant and rapid improvement in the health of the older population.10 \n\n>Workers’ choice of the age at which to claim Social Security retirement benefits moves in tandem with increases in the normal retirement age.11,12 Therefore, we can expect that the birth cohorts with a higher normal retirement age will retire and claim benefits at a later age than previous cohorts—despite the fact that they are in worse health on most dimensions. The likely consequence is an increase in the share of workers in their fifties and sixties who are in poor health, which will create significant challenges for them and their employers. Applications for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits may also rise, with insurance payments helping people who are unable to work at the higher ages. These benefits, however, are not likely to fully meet the need filled by Social Security retirement benefits.\n\n >The Social Security Trust Fund is currently projected to be depleted in 2034.13 Increasing the normal retirement age is a commonly proposed solution to this fiscal challenge. However, given the recent changes in health among the cohorts now approaching typical retirement age, further increases in the normal retirement age would place a substantial and disproportionate burden on these cohorts.\n', 1, 'dp9w2nj', '58'),

(169, 'Wow I never thought my actual PhD research would come up on reddit but here I am, color me surprised.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBasically the short answer is yes, my lab has proven many times that using micro/nano structures surfaces and hydrophobic surfaces can reduce skin friction drag on a surface moving through the water. Basically all it does is create a layer of air (called a plastron) between the skin of the ship and the water, and since the friction coefficient of water over air is much lower than water over a surface, the friction is reduced. This is very similar to why a golf ball has dimples. We have shown that you can reduce the skin friction drag of a ship hull by close to 90%, but this is only the friction, this does not account for form drag.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe real challenges right now are two fold, manufacturing ability and durability. I’ll start with the manufacturing because that is easier. A lot of the coatings we have developed are completely in-feasible for a ship because it either requires super precise etching (like you see in a microchip processing laboratory) or it requires harsh chemicals and you can’t really dip an entire ship in a giant vat of chemicals. So what we are working on right now is a simple coating that could be painted or sprayed on that would induce similar results.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow we have been successful in making one that can be sprayed, but this brings with it, it’s own challenges. First is the durability, many hydrophobic coatings are not durable on a metal surface and would end up just rubbing off after a short amount of time, we have created one that is pretty durable and is very promising so far in testing. The next challenge we are encountering is the durability of the plastron (the air layer between the hull and the water). This has been shown to break down over time, most likely from the air diffusing into the water, but it hasn’t been shown yet. But if you keep the plastron connected to the atmosphere (ie the air layer extends all the way to above the water line) then it appears this can be mitigated because your air layer is/can always be ‘refreshed’ with more air. What I am currently researching is how to we make a surface that is completely submerged (like a submarine) maintain a stable air layer with no connection to the atmosphere. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nKind of a long answer to your question but it is a huge field of interest right now and has a lot of money/potential in it!\n\nTL;DR yes it would, but it also isn’t really relevant on sailboat racing because it is banned by the RRS\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: I also just want to clarify for people that not ALL coatings shear off at speed. One of the coatings I am testing with has shown numerous days of durability at about 20 m/s flow and absolutely no affect of the structure. The key is preventing wetting. If the coating wets, then yes, it will not last long because water is so much more ‘abrasive’ but if you maintain that air layer, it will last a long long time.', 3, 'dp9uj1h', '43'),

The air layer is what essentially lubricates the flow. This air layer is very thin and will easily dissolve into the water under pressure. Additionally if the wetting interface isn\'t ideal, and if the flow is remotely unsteady and most likely turbulent, you will get partial wetting of the roughness so you can increase the drag.

The man has been a medic for over 20 years and I\'m SURE has seen nastier things, (I\'m a medic myself now, and I know I have), but watching a gay man have a tantrum deserves to be on this list. It was gay as fuck. \n\nA touching \'gay\' moment- at my high school graduation, my dad\'s husband gave me bright pink wedges (so they could see which one out of the sea of blue I was) and a pair of his late grandmother\'s earrings. I cried. His grandmother raised him after his mother lost a battle with cancer, and I was close to her as well before she passed when I was 9. I\'m his only child, even though I\'m not bio. \n\nWe all have assigned parts when any Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, George Michael, or Boy George song comes on. \n\nThat being said, honestly, they\'re two fairly normal guys. Very few moments in my life have made me go, "Okay, that was the gayest thing I have ever seen you do, IN MY LIFE." I\'m very grateful for my parents.

(320, 'Back when I was in college, I was acquainted with a young man who was one of the most talented musicians I have ever met. He could play just about any instrument that he encountered, usually with a level of skill that would make professional performers jealous. This fellow and I started spending a lot of time together after I commissioned him to write the score for a short film that I was producing, and even after the project was done, we kept hanging out.\n\nNow, most of the time, this young man and I would sit in his apartment, smoke hookah, and eat cookies... but every so often, we\'d decide to try something crazy. (For example, we once got drunk on plum wine and recorded a ballad-like cover of "Dragostea Din Tei.") On one such evening, we found ourselves wandering around Broadway Street in San Francisco, which is the closest thing that the city has to an official red light district. As we walked, it came out that my companion – who was gay, I should mention – had never seen a woman naked, and I took his admission as an excuse to steer us toward a strip club of sorts.\n\nThe establishment in question used the "peep show" method, which requires that a person sit in a booth, deposit dollar bills into a little slot, and then watch through a window after a mechanical shutter has risen. As my friend and I soon found out, though, the tiny spaces were only meant to hold one would-be ogler at a time, and we had that fact further explained to us after the naked woman on the other side of the plexiglass saw two of us sitting there.\n\n"You guys can\'t be in there together unless you\'re a couple," she said.\n\nI glanced at the young man next to me. "Oh, uh... we are," I replied.\n\n"Really?" the girl answered. The skepticism on her face was all too evident. "Can you guys make out a little, then?"\n\nI have to confess, I hesitated... but only because I wasn\'t sure if my companion would have any desire to kiss me, and I didn\'t want to be presumptuous. Fortunately, he gently reached up to my face, ran his fingers through my hair, then pulled our heads together for a long, drawn-out (and comically exaggerated, if I\'m honest) kiss. I responded in kind, holding the back of his neck in my palm while making a show of pulling him closer with my free hand.\n\nIt was apparently believable enough for the nude entertainer, because she nodded, then spread her legs toward us. As our luck would have it, though, that was the exact moment when the shutter – which we\'d only paid to be open for about a minute – started whirring shut. My friend and I briefly debated the prospect of putting another dollar into the slot, but we ultimately decided against it.\n\n"I\'ve seen enough," he said to me, "to say with complete confidence that I\'m *definitely* gay."\n\n"I learned something about myself tonight," I replied. The young man turned to look into my eyes. "After kissing you like that," I continued, "I can say with complete confidence that I\'m *definitely* straight."\n\nMy companion breathed a sigh of relief.

We know the thing "c" typically by the name "hypotenuse". You know c must have a certain value which is dependent on the value of the other variables due to their spacial configuration.\n\nEnergy is kind of the same idea. Because events happen in predictable ways that have time symmetry (in other words, it does not matter whether we do an experiment today or tomorrow, the laws of physics should not differ) this yields a quantity we call "energy" for which the total amount must be equal before and after an event unfolds.', 23, 'dp96n9q', '10'),
(951, '>From what I understand all (?) energy in QM is represented by photons.\n\npeople often think photons are somehow "pure energy", equate "pure energy" to photons, etc, but that not at all true. every particle has energy, systems have energy. particularly for the electromagnetic interaction, when a charged particle (like an electron in an atom) changes state it emits  or absorbs the difference in energy as photons. but that\'s specific to the e.m. interaction and not a general characterisation.', 23, 'dp9d4ol', '2'),
(952, 'In a first-year course, yeah, it seems a little arbitrary. Say you start with this basic kinematic equation for gravity (for an object moving from height y_0 to height y, with g=-9.8 m/s^2 ):\n\nv^2 = v_0^(2) + 2g(y-y_0)\n\nNow multiply by m/2:\n\n1/2 mv^(2) + mgy = 1/2 mv_0^(2)+mgy_0\n\nThat\'s your energy conservation equation. We can just decide to give these terms names: one is "kinetic energy," the other is "gravitational potential energy." (If you\'re worried about motion in the other two dimensions, you can just add "1/2m(v_x^2 + v+z^(2)" to both sides, noting that v^(2) = v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^(2).)\n\nNow it\'s pretty clear as a matter of basic kinematics that, if gravity is the only force in play, the sum of the so-called "kinetic energy" + "potential energy" never changes. And the same goes for many other forces, though the associated "potential energy" formula may look different. (These are called "conservative forces.") So for now, you can think of it as just a convenient mathematical trick. It seems awfully lucky that *so many* forces are conservative, and in fact there are deeper reasons behind it, but you\'ll learn about that later. ', 23, 'dp9nlk5', '2'),

They are all just mathematical definitions, and you learn to interpret them physically after working through some examples.\n\nIn QM, it\'s definitely a lot more abstract: energy is the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian operator - it doesn\'t really have to do with photons at all. In general, how QM works is you replace all classical properties (position, momentum, energy) with *operators*, and the eigenvalues of those operators give the possible values you can observe.', 23, 'dp9ameq', '1'),

Having already employed black-powder explosives to breach two of the lesser pyramids on site, he sent for his blasting crew and broke into the lowermost relieving chamber, testing its ceiling and likewise finding void-backed cracks. Hoping for treasure and settling for political favor, he eventually forced entry to all five chambers while naming them for his political patrons back home.\n\nThe Grand Gallery was perhaps spared such intrusions because it has a much higher, narrower ceiling and a sloping floor. Yet it likely follows the design of the pyramid\'s other planned passages and chambers, which all have a cap of paired granite blocks meeting at a peak as their ultimate ceiling.\n\nWe could easily explore the Grand Passage ceiling today with sectional poles, probing the existing cracks much the way Vyse did. Unlike Vyse, we\'d leave off the explosives and raise up battery-operated diamond drills instead, poking 8mm boreholes into any voids before snaking in an inspection camera.\n\nAn even less invasive approach would be to measure the combined air volume of the Grand Gallery and its topside relieving chamber(s). Since thin gaps between the granite beams presumably allow air to move back and forth from the gallery to the spaces above and back, and since the surrounding core blocks of the pyramid are airtight, we could measure volume simply by cycling the pressure up and down inside the gallery and measuring how much air has to be spilled in or out to achieve particular pressures.', 26, 'dp9imgv', '9'),

Measles infection has a nasty habit of "deprogramming" your immune system\'s memory which was recently found to be a long term effect (2-3 years).  So, kids who get measles aren\'t just at risk of dying from measles complications but also are more likely to die of other infections.  Getting vaccinated protects kids not just from measles but also maintains a healthier immune system.\n\nsource:  [Long-term measles-induced immunomodulation increases overall childhood infectious disease mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4823017/)\n\n>    **Abstract**: Immunosuppression after measles is known to predispose people to opportunistic infections for a period of several weeks to months. Using population-level data, we show that measles has a more prolonged effect on host resistance, extending over 2 to 3 years. We find that nonmeasles infectious disease mortality in high-income countries is tightly coupled to measles incidence at this lag, in both the pre- and post-vaccine eras. We conclude that long-term immunologic sequelae of measles drive interannual fluctuations in nonmeasles deaths. This is consistent with recent experimental work that attributes the immunosuppressive effects of measles to depletion of B and T lymphocytes. Our data provide an explanation for the long-term benefits of measles vaccination in preventing all-cause infectious disease. By preventing measles-associated immune memory loss, vaccination protects polymicrobial herd immunity.\n\n\nFor some popular reporting of the issue: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27481-measles-leaves-you-vulnerable-to-a-host-of-deadly-diseases/', 27, 'dp8zjj8', '125'),

These resembled two people conversing in the distance, just beyond the range of the understanding of listeners.\n     \nResearchers traced these sounds back to one male white whale, Noc, when a diver surfaced from the whale enclosure to ask his colleagues an odd question: "Who told me to get out?" The investigators concluded sounds resembling "out" came from Noc. \n     \nThere were plenty of opportunities for Noc to hear human speech. He had previously overheard people talking at the surface, and had also heard them using devices that allowed them to speak with divers underwater.\nAnecdotal reports have surfaced in the past of whales sounding like humans. For instance, at Vancouver Aquarium, keepers suggested that a white whale about 15 years of age had uttered his name, "Lagosi."\n\nIn a more rigorous test to see if Noc could mimic humans, scientists rewarded him with snacks when he made those sounds, prompting him to do so enough times for them to capture recordings.\nAnalysis of Noc\'s sounds revealed a rhythm similar to human speech. They also displayed fundamental frequencies several octaves lower than typical whale sounds and far closer to that of the human voice."\n    \nThis is fascinating. ', 29, 'dp8kuc8', '1763'),

First all of my aunt\'s and uncles and parents circulated it each Christmas in the gift exchange. Then my oldest sister got married. She was the first of all of this generation - my generation. So she and her husband got gifted this window-sized, lifelike painting of my great-grandparents.\n\n\nMy family loves to just poke fun. My aunts insisted that the portrait be hung in a prominent position in the new marital house to show respect for our elders. My uncles insisted the portrait remain there for one year.\n\n\nSure enough, my sister and brother-in-law went to town. Candles, cloth, rosary beads (we\'re Christian but not Catholic so this is beyond me), all were piled around the painting which hung directly above the mantel. (Actually it\'s ever so slightly larger than the width of the fireplace, so directly above plus a little more.)\n\n\nIt hung for one year with this shrine dedicated to my deceased great-grandparents.\n\n\nThen my cousin Stephanie got married. Guess what she and her husband received for Christmas that year?\n\n\nTo this day every family has hung the portrait (well...to be honest, only my sister kept it up the whole time. Most people have kept it hidden and hastily put it up when family comes over. It\'s creepy AF).\n\n\nIf I didn\'t know the story I would NOT RETURN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN. ', 34, 'dp9z35g', '115'),

(1827, 'On the experiment itself:\n\n> Emily designed an experiment in which the healer and Emily were separated by a screen. Then Emily decided, by flipping a coin, whether to put her hand over the healer\'s left hand or the right hand. The healer was asked to decide where Emily\'s hand was hovering. If the healer could detect Emily\'s human energy field, he or she should be able to discern where Emily\'s hand was.  \n>  \n> In 280 tests involving the 21 practitioners, the healers did no better than chance. They identified the correct location of Emily\'s hand just 44 percent of the time; if they guessed at random, they would have been right about half the time.\n\nThat\'s right, they did worse than *a flipped coin*!\n\nWhy Emily did this:\n\n> Mrs. Rosa said Emily originally was designing a science fair experiment involving different colored M&M\'s candy. Then she glanced at the television screen in her home where her mother was watching a videotape about therapeutic touch. Suddenly, Emily piped up, saying she had a way to test the premise of therapeutic touch, her mother said.\n\nEmily\'s mother, Linda Rosa, R.N., after asking to her local board of nursing whether therapeutic touch has scientific evidence, was sent to read articles from women\'s magazines or tabloid newspapers.\n\nOf course, the practicioners protested the results; an answer to their protests is available [here](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ttresponse.html) by Larry Sarner.\n\n> \'\'I do hope it\'s an April Fool\'s joke,\'\' said Dr. Dolores Krieger, an emeritus professor of nursing at New York University who is a developer of therapeutic touch.  \n>  \n> Dr. Krieger and other therapeutic touch practitioners insist that they and anyone else who is trained can easily feel human energy fields. In her book, \'\'Accepting Your Power to Heal\'\' (Bear & Company. Publishing, Santa Fe. N.M., 1993) Dr. Krieger said the field feels like \'\'warm Jell-O or warm foam.\'\'\n\nAs for the study itself, just read the abstract below and the rest [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/187390).\n\n> **Context.**— Therapeutic Touch (TT) is a widely used nursing practice rooted in mysticism but alleged to have a scientific basis. Practitioners of TT claim to treat many medical conditions by using their hands to manipulate a "human energy field" perceptible above the patient\'s skin.  \n>  \n> **Objective.**— To investigate whether TT practitioners can actually perceive a "human energy field."  \n>  \n> **Design.**— Twenty-one practitioners with TT experience for from 1 to 27 years were tested under blinded conditions to determine whether they could correctly identify which of their hands was closest to the investigator\'s hand. Placement of the investigator\'s hand was determined by flipping a coin. Fourteen practitioners were tested 10 times each, and 7 practitioners were tested 20 times each.  \n>  \n>  **Main Outcome Measure.**— Practitioners of TT were asked to state whether the investigator\'s unseen hand hovered above their right hand or their left hand. To show the validity of TT theory, the practitioners should have been able to locate the investigator\'s hand 100% of the time. A score of 50% would be expected through chance alone.  \n>  \n> **Results.**— Practitioners of TT identified the correct hand in only 123 (44%) of 280 trials, which is close to what would be expected for random chance. There was no significant correlation between the practitioner\'s score and length of experience (r=0.23). The statistical power of this experiment was sufficient to conclude that if TT practitioners could reliably detect a human energy field, the study would have demonstrated this.  \n>  \n> **Conclusions.**— Twenty-one experienced TT practitioners were unable to detect the investigator\'s "energy field." Their failure to substantiate TT\'s most fundamental claim is unrefuted evidence that the claims of TT are groundless and that further professional use is unjustified.\n\n*ADDENDUM*: Linda Risa, Emily\'s mother, [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/hmrod/a_research_by_9yrold_emily_rosa_the_youngest/c1wpg2a/) on r/science, adding informations on how was the experience run.\n\nAnd thank you, my two anonymous admirers, for my first Reddit gold!\n\nEDIT:\n\n* **First edit (four hours after)*: Added the abstract.\n* **Second edit (November 3, 09:31 UTC)**: Added link to commebt from u/LindaRosaRN and thanks for my two first Reddit gold.', 40, 'dp8e5l1', '537'),

They are unique in that they involve the entire water column (unlike normal wind driven surface waves), but in the open ocean they have very long wavelengths so for most creatures in the water column the passing of a tsunami wave would be barely noticeable.\n\nEarthquakes which generate tsunami do so by displacing water, which means there needs to be deformation of the ocean floor (i.e. a surface rupture of the fault that produced the earthquake). For example, in the Tohoku earthquake which caused the large tsunami in Japan in 2011, portions of the sea floor were [vertically displaced by ~10 meters](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1240). One could imagine if you happened to have misfortune of being some sort of benthic organism living right in that area, you may have been killed by debris from this scarp falling on top of you after the earthquake, but this would be limited to things living right at the rupture and again, we don\'t have any actual assessment of what this meant for deep sea creatures.\n\nAt the surface, tsunamis can have pretty big effects on marine organisms. Lots of shallow marine organisms can be washed on land (and die) and there is also the influx of material from the near shore into the shallow marine environment that can disrupt things.

When we arrived it was decided we would drive around and see what we could see before setting up. Since the park had no large predators and we would just be driving around slowly, my brother and I would ride around on the spare tire on the hood of the car (a Landrover Defender). After driving around for a while, not seeing much, my brother decided the flies were getting too obnoxious and got back into the car; I thought I would brave it out a little longer, and rode the hood alone. \n\nNot 5 minutes after my dad continued driving did the flies seem to suddenly get way worse. Not a few more... hundreds more. I needed to get inside. The car had stopped, so I jumped off the hood, and that is when I felt it. Stings. I was being swarmed by bees, not flies.\n\nI just started screaming. A bloodcurtling scream of a 10 year old. I ran around the side of the car but the doors weren\'t open so I kept running. Screaming. The bees were going into my mouth and stinging my tongue. My mother leaped out of the car and threw me in the back seat. My dad put the peddle to the floor and we flew down the tiny dirt road, but the swarm was with us. My mother was throwing camping mats over me to try and keep bees off, but I was covered. I have flashes of memories trying to pull them off of my face with my hands and throw them out of the window, but I have no idea if I had stopped screaming yet.\n\nAfter the few seconds of racing down the road, my mother yelled for my brother. He wasn\'t in the car. He had jumped out when I was pulled in and got left standing in the road. Full props for driving ability here, because my dad threw the truck into reverse and barreled BACK down the dirt road. My brother was standing where we left him perfectly fine. The bees were with us. He reluctantly got in with us and the remainder of the swarm and we sped off again, driving until it seemed were safe.\n\nWe all jumped out of the car. I was breathing heavily and repeating "I AM GOING TO DIE" over and over again, but eventually my parents were able to calm me down and we got in the car.\n\n"So are we still going camping?" My dad asks. "NO WE ARE NOT GOING CAMPING," my mom replies. And we started the two hour drive to the nearest hospital. On the way I threw up on the side of the road from shock.

Once at the hospital they told us if I wasn\'t dead now I would be fine.\n\nEpilogue: the bees I was attacked by were African killer bees. Not named such because any single bee is more deadly, but because they are more aggressive, make larger swarms, and will follow targets farther, typically aiming for the head and face. We presume the loud Land rover engine aggravated them to swarm, and I was the shiny hood ornament. I did not develope an allergy following the incident, and do not have a phobia.

As I was trying to run fast, I was very heavy footed so halfway up the old stairs I must have slammed down too hard and the stairs collapsed in and I fell through. The girl I was racing wasn\'t covered in the debris like I was but started screaming to get the other two to come over. \n\nI literally could not move my legs or my right arm. I could reach into my pocket with my left and pulled out my torch (it was dark af cus the debris was like all around me) I managed to get wooden shit off my arm and tried to move it off my leg but it was soooo heavy. At this point, I could only hear my friend screaming so I thought we were just fucked. I sorta said to myself, "this is it. fuck. nm." and I remember being really chill with dying. Kinda creepy. Also, because we were way ahead of the other groups, there was no chance of the others coming to help for a long time.\n\nBut then my mate and the other girl pulled the massive wood thing (which turned out to be the Bannister with some stair things on.\n\nYeah I was okay. Like I got bruised but the next day I walked fine. \n\nWe didn\'t tell anyone else about it. Good times.', 57, 'dpbzboj', '8'),

The replacement tail includes a regenerated spinal cord with a simple morphology: an ependymal layer surrounded by nerve tracts. We hypothesized that cells within the ependymal layer of the original spinal cord include populations of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) that contribute to the regenerated spinal cord. Prior to tail loss, we performed a bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase experiment and found that a subset of ependymal layer cells (ELCs) were label-retaining after a 140-day chase period. Next, we conducted a detailed spatiotemporal characterization of these cells before, during, and after tail regeneration. Our findings show that SOX2, a hallmark protein of NSPCs, is constitutively expressed by virtually all ELCs before, during, and after regeneration. We also found that during regeneration, ELCs express an expanded panel of NSPC and lineage-restricted progenitor cell markers, including MSI-1, SOX9, and TUJ1. Using electron microscopy, we determined that multiciliated, uniciliated, and biciliated cells are present, although the latter was only observed in regenerated spinal cords. Our results demonstrate that cells within the ependymal layer of the original, regenerating and fully regenerate spinal cord represent a heterogeneous population. These include radial glia comparable to Type E and Type B cells, and a neuronal-like population of cerebrospinal fluid-contacting cells. We propose that spinal cord regeneration in geckos represents a truncation of the restorative trajectory observed in some urodeles and teleosts, resulting in the formation of a structurally distinct replacement.', 76, 'dpbzovq', '11'),

Here, we report that in vivo knockdown or conditional knockout of the autism-linked ubiquitin ligase RNF8 or associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 in rodent cerebellar granule neurons robustly increases the number of parallel fiber presynaptic boutons and functional parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses. In contrast to the role of nuclear RNF8 in proliferating cells, RNF8 operates in the cytoplasm in neurons to suppress synapse differentiation in vivo. Proteomics analyses reveal that neuronal RNF8 interacts with the HECT domain protein HERC2 and scaffold protein NEURL4, and knockdown of HERC2 or NEURL4 phenocopies the inhibition of RNF8/UBC13 signaling on synapse differentiation. In behavior analyses, granule neuron-specific knockout of RNF8 or UBC13 impairs cerebellar-dependent learning. Our study defines RNF8 and UBC13 as components of a novel cytoplasmic ubiquitin-signaling network that suppresses synapse formation in the brain.', 77, 'dpbxtnz', '4'),

(3269, 'Some things I\'d like to point out:\n\nWe don\'t KNOW the nature of Rosemary\'s "mental illness".  It is not well-documented.  She did have birth complications which caused intellectual disability but that is different than behavioral and emotional problems of acting out and presenting a danger to herself and others. \n\n Interpretations vary of whether she had another mental condition (an actual psychosis) or just acting out in a competitive male-dominated household with no place for her.  Or whether she had any behavioral problems at all.\n\nWatts and Freeman were BIG in promoting their new "lobotomy" invention as the answer to everything, like mental disorders came from scar tissue you needed to break up and it just regenerated clean after that.  They were well-respected.\n\nI\'m saying Joe Kennedy WAS listening to doctors\' advice at the time and could reasonably believe that a lobotomy could help her without serious side effects.  They were well-respected as professionals, albeit dead wrong.  But, he didn\'t tell his wife about what was being done to their daughter until after.  Which does raise onerous questions about what he thought this was.  Did he really think the doctors knew best and his wife was not to be burdened with this decision?  I really don\'t know.\n\nI can\'t help but think Watts and Freeman and their lobotomy was like Tzar Nicholas\' family and Rasputin "curing" their son\'s hemophilia... and they came to believe he was magic, a seer, and could fix everything.\n\nKeep in mind the mental health field didn\'t have a lot of options, this was before medication was widely available.  Antipsychotics like thorazine wouldn\'t be invented for another 10 years.  The main option for many cases was restraint- almost lifelong, sometimes- and a lot of resources spent cleaning shit smeared all over the walls.  So doctors and families were desperate for solutions in a way that\'s hard to relate to now.\n\nOf that, Watts was by far the more professional physician.  Freeman, who was NOT trained as a surgeon, went on a nationwide lobotomizing rampage, and that\'s not even a hyperbole.  He toured the country in his "lobotomobile", said anyone- nurses- could do a lobotomy and showed everyone how.\n\nWatts didn\'t know what Freeman was doing until much later, he was HORRIFIED.  Watts did not believe it would be a cure-all and had serious risks.  Freeman had performed 3,439 lobotomies PERSONALLY, on anyone, with no diligence in case review.  Morning, noon, night, line \'em up, $25.\n\n\nHere\'s what bothered me:\n\nFreeman continued his popular rampage for 10+ YEARS after Rosemary.  A high-profile failure like that COULD HAVE discredited him and stopped him, but likely at great cost to the Kennedy legacy.  They were silent.\n\nHorrifyingly, you CAN say this was basically an inspiration for Atwood\'s *Handmaid\'s Tale*.  Rosemary, just a bit "slow" mentally, wanted to escape her father\'s shadow.  She was sent off to a convent boarding school, but started to escape at night, possibly having sex (no evidence of that), and given a lobotomy to "cure" her which her father and male doctors all thought would be for the best and make life easier for her.', 82, 'dpc2xta', '2'),

Before going into those, I\'ll provide some background info.\n\nDuring Rosemary\'s birth, Rosemary was held in the birth canal for quite some time because the nurse (who was perfectly qualified to deliver her) wanted to wait for the doctor to arrive. The delay of oxygen may have had an effect on her intellectual development later, but it is not certain. Rosemary, compared to the rest of her siblings, always struggled more. From early on, even with a tutor she had difficulty mastering the basics of reading and writing. However, Rosemary was perceptive enough to notice her performance compared with her siblings, and this would frustrate her. Later, the Kennedys\' sent her to a boarding school for the intellectually challenged kids. Rosemary hated it. From that point on she would change schools every few years due to severe mood swings, teachers feeling unequipped to help with her disabilities, and her parents believing a change in environment would be best for her. Her father always thought Rosemary was a bit "backwards" and her siblings always were told to keep an eye on her, which could make them impatient with her at times. Eventually, Rosemary returned home (around her early 20s at this point), and Rose was not doing well. She was having seizures, having violent tantrums, and going though a bit of a rebellious phase. \n\nEventually, Rosemary was subjected to an experimental prefrontal lobotomy. The reasons why are that:\n\nThe Kennedys were afraid that the public knowing about Rosemary would hurt her siblings\'/family\'s reputation, she was growing into a beautiful woman and they were also afraid a man would take advantage of her-leading to a scandal that could also damage the family reputation, and they were probably afraid she would hurt someone.

(3773, 'As already said, you can transform the relative velocity away and consider the statistic of the system at rest. But if your really insisted on including the relative motion then it would\'t change anything: \n\nConsider a system S\' which is moving with velocity V  relative to another system S. The velocities as viewed from S are given as (all quantities are understood as vectors)\n\n`[; v_i = v\'_i + V ;]`\n\nIf we put this in the Lagrangian for the Particles in system S:\n\n`[; L = \\sum \\frac{1}{2} m_i (v\'_i + V)^2  - U  ;]`\n\n`[; L = \\sum \\frac{1}{2} m_i (v\'_i)^2 + V \\sum m_i v_i\'  +  \\frac{1}{2} V^2\\sum_i m_i  - U ;]`\n\n`[; L = \\left(T_{\\text{int}}-U\\right)+ \\text{relative velocity}\\times\\text{centre of mass of the particles in S\'}  +  \\text{kinetic energy of the center of mass} ;]`\n\nWhen the COM is at rest with respect to S\', then\n\n`[; L = L_{\\text{int}}(r_i\',v_i\') +  L_{\\text{COM}}(V) ;]`\n\nSo formally, when the COM is at rest w.r.t. a system S\', and this system is moving with velocity V w.r.t. to a system S, then the Lagrangian is a sum of two systems: the system of the internal movement of the particles and the system of the moving COM.\n\nNow, when we have two systems, their entropies add:\n\n`[; S = S_{int} + S_{COM} ;]`\n\nor\n\n`[; S = k_B ~ ln(\\Omega_{int}) + k_B~ ln(\\Omega_{COM}) ;]`\n\nWe need to know the number of available microstates for the COM system, `[; \\Omega_{COM} ;]` . Normally you do this by counting all states within a given energy interval. The point is that, when the system is moving *uniformly* relative to us, then V_x, V_y, V_z in `[; \\frac{1}{2}M V^2 ;]` are given and there is no need to sum/integrate over the different momenta. There is only one microstate. Therefore `[; \\Omega_{COM}=1 ;]` and `[; ln(\\Omega_{COM})=0 ;]` . So the entropy of the COM movement doesn\'t contribute to the overall entropy. But, as Iamlord7 said, \n\nT = 1/(∂S/∂U)_(N,V) ,\n\ntherefore the relative motion doesn\'t contribute to temperature. (Things get more complicated when the system is moving relativistically... And sorry for the formal overkill, I have a statistical mechanics exam soon and I thought this was a good small exercise in thinking about this stuff.)\n', 87, 'dpby2vm', '2'),
(3774, '>I get the general idea that temperature is about "random" motion, but philosophically, how can we distinguish how random is "random" enough?\n\nFirst, note that it\'s actually very neat and easy to separate the kinetic energy due to *overall* motion from the kinetic energy due to thermal motion, mathematically speaking. That is, you can separate the overall energy into a sum of different terms, some of which only depend on the speed of the center of mass or the overall rotation speed of the object, while others only depend on how individual particles are moving *relative* to the center of mass. For example if you have a system made of only two particles with equal mass m and velocities v1, v2 then the total kinetic energy is\n\nE = 1/2 mv1^2 + 1/2 mv2^2\n\nNow the velocity of the center of mass is the average, V= 1/2 (v1 + v2); and the relative velocity of (for example) the first particle is v1-V= 1/2 (v1-v2). Then we can write \n\nE  = 1/2 (m+m)V^2 + 1/2m(v1-V)^2 + 1/2m(v2-V)^2\n\nand a little algebra will prove that this is equivalent to the previous expression. The first term is the kinetic energy due to the overall motion of the object (which depends on your reference frame), and the rest is the internal energy (which does not). \n\nFurthermore, we can prove from conservation of momentum that the overall velocity V can\'t change, unless the system interacts with some outside force. But the relative velocities can certainly change if the particles interact with each other. In the cases where thermodynamics applies, we usually can\'t measure or predict those individual velocities; they\'re essentially random, at least as far as we\'re concerned. \n\nNow, suppose that the overall kinetic energy is *equal* to E. Then we immediately know the relative velocities (v1-V) and (v2-V): they must be zero. Not much uncertainty there! Similarly if the internal energy is nonzero but still very small, then there\'s only a very small range of values that v1 and v2 could have (clustered tightly around V), so in a sense there\'s still not all that much randomness involved. But when the internal energy gets large, there\'s more room for variation.\n\nEntropy takes it a little farther, allowing the overall (macroscopic) behavior of the system to be described by other variables in addition to kinetic energy. Still the idea is similar: in some sense we\'re quantifying the number of different "microstates" that are possible, given the values of those macroscopic variables (the "macrostate.") This is sort of tantamount to quantifying how much *information* the macrostate gives us: how much does it narrow down the range of possibilities? And in fact there\'s a related concept of "entropy" in pure information theory.', 87, 'dpbzvdj', '2'),
(3775, 'u/mfb has alluded to this, but I thought I would expand on it (as they put it, \'get into the mathematical details\') in case you\'re interested - the actual thermodynamic definition of temperature is this:\n\nT = 1/(∂S/∂U)*_N,V_*\n\nWhat this means is that the quantity we call temperature is defined as the inverse of the rate of change of entropy with respect to internal energy, holding the number of particles and volume constant. Now there are a number of ways to think about entropy, but probably the best way to think about it here is as the amount of energy that is not \'useful\' - that is, we can\'t use it to do *work* on anything. \n\nSo we can kind of think about it this way: if you have a system of particles with some overall kinetic energy, like a bottle of water moving at some speed, or a baseball in flight, that kinetic energy can be extracted from the bottle or ball to do work on something, for example me as the baseball smacks into my glove and moves my hand some distance. I can\'t do that with the microscopic motion of the baseball\'s particles. Thermodynamics doesn\'t allow me to extract meaningful energy with which to do work from the thermal motions of the water molecules in the bottle. So when thinking about whether something contributes to the temperature, you can sort of think about whether or not that energy is available to do work with. If so, the answer is probably no, it doesn\'t contribute to the temperature.\n\nMy thermo is a bit rusty, so please do correct me if I\'ve made a mistake or I\'ve grossly misunderstood something.

(4060, 'You\'re quite right that a lot of the popular science explanations of quantum computing are unhelpful at best and sometimes even simply wrong.\n\nHere\'s my best attempt -- forget everything you think you know about qubits and bits and start from scratch.\nA quantum computation begins by preparing a state (using however many quantum systems as necessary) that represents a combination (an entangled superposition) of all potential answers to a problem.\nWe then manipulate/interact with that state in such a way that the wrong answers cancel out and the right answers reinforce (interference).  \nThen we read out the answer. That\'s all.\n\nUnlike with classical computers, where we built them and then figured out what we could do with them, in quantum computing the theory is ahead of the experiment. But it\'s still not very advanced.\n\nWorking purely theoretically we have found the right quantum operations to solve a few problems, like integer factorisation.\n[NIST maintains a list](http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/).\nIt is not clear that the quantum version is faster in practice in all cases.\nIt is not clear that a quantum algorithm exists for all problems, or even all interesting problems. These are open theoretical questions.\n\nExperimentally things are even more basic. D-Wave have built a quantum computer that is essentially hard-wired to only solve minimisation problems. It\'s an impressive engineering achievement to connect up so many (up to 2000 now I believe) superconducting qubits, but it is not clear if their design is general enough to be useful for other problems, or if it is even providing a real speedup vs a classical computer.\n\nA few others (IBM, UCSB, many other academic institutions) have built more obviously general purpose quantum computers but I believe the current record is 17 qubits. Right now it is basically a toy to slowly test the theory.\nIts not a simple task to scale up a quantum computer as every single qubit needs to have a controllable interaction with every other qubit. So doubling the number of qubits means 4 times as many connections to worry about.\nAnd if the qubit starts to interact too much with the other qubits or the environment, your carefully prepared quantum state will be changed. Noise and isolation from the environment is a huge problem. Quantum error correction is proving to be crucial.\n\nAll this doesn\'t mean I\'m pessimistic about quantum computing -- we have already proven it will be useful for certain specific problems, and with hard work I am confident the engineering challenges will be overcome; we are not so far from being useful in very specific situations.\nBut we have a long way to go yet and a lot of the hype for general-purpose quantum computing is overblown.\n\nI refer everyone I can to [this SMBC comic](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3).', 96, 'dpb9i9o', '8'),

The book is titled How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk, an easy read with illustrations, and immediately I saw positive results in just the first chapter of reading.  I no longer invalidated their irrational feelings because whether or not the child was acting rational or logical they were in fact feeling the way they felt, so when I focused on their irrational behavior or response to something they shut down.  So, I sucked up my pride and did the opposite of what felt natural, I acknowledged their feelings and we talked about that part first and guess what?  It was like magic!  They opened up and when I did finally get to the part about how they were acting irrational they were completely open and apologized!  It makes sense though, kids have little power and when adults laugh at or belittle how they actually feel then they\'re even less in control of anything and the shut down.  It doesn\'t matter how good our intentions are and how much we might think it\'s wrong to validate their feelings when the feelings seem completely unjustified, they\'re going to shut down unless they feel we\'really their advocate, that we actually DO care.

(4531, 'Okay, a lot of these are wrong. I\'m an archaeologist so let me try to clear some of these misconceptions up. \n\nYou are generally going to find fossils within sedimentary rock, and there are a few types of sedimentary deposition. The most common is by water, where tiny pieces of sediment (not dirt, sediment is weathered/eroded pieces of other rock) are placed either by tides, or simply by falling through water. \n\nThe other major type of sedimentary deposition is aeolian, or Loess deposition. Instead if the sediment being carried by water, it\'s carried by the wind. China has a gigantic Loess plateau, which is interesting because if you examine the types of sediment you can get a complete record of that areas climatic conditions. \n\nAs far as fossilization goes, fossils will preserve best when they are deposited quickly, so in an area with a high rate of sedimentation. Many aquatic environments will do this, or landslides, or areas that have sediment windblown quickly. But remember this is generally a very SLOW process, but it happens over enormous timescales. \n\nSorry for writing a book but I hope this helps. \n\nEDIT: Upon rereading the title I noticed you said "dinosaurs" and "centuries" at the same time. Some archaeology is done from centuries old, these you can find by digging down. Dinosaurs haven\'t been around since 65 Ma (millions of years ago), typically these sites are found via exposure due to weathering, which is how people know where to look for dinosaur sites. \n\nAlso, if anyone is curious I deal with paleolithic archaeology, a nice happy medium between historic arch and paleontology.

(4533, 'What is missing from all of the answers is the concept of [subsidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidence). Imagine you\'re in a basin where sediment is actively being deposited by a river. As sediment is left behind by the river, this is increasing the mass of sediment in a given spot (a little bit more has been added to the top of a column of rock). This does two things: (1) it causes compaction of the sediment beneath it (decreasing the size of pore space, etc) and (2) because of [isostasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy) it causes the entire column of rock to \'sink\' a tiny amount. These both have the effect of lowering the surface elevation of the area where that sediment is deposited. On top of this, there can be tectonic forces that produce \'tectonic subsidence\'. A common form of this is the formation of a basin via flexure of the lithosphere, [e.g. a foreland basin that forms next to a mountain range because the mountain range itself flexes down the crust (imagine a weight on an elastic sheet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreland_basin#Lithospheric_behavior). \n\nAs described by many of the other answers, erosion through the action of rivers and glaciers moves sediment from higher to lower areas, but importantly sediment is only deposited if there is \'accommodation space\', meaning basically that there is a low spot to fill in with the sediment. That accommodation space is generated by subsidence.', 103, 'dpdinku', '20'),

(4535, 'So the theory of stratification is the theory that the deeper the layers (strata) of unmoved earth the older they are. How layers of strata form is through the formation of sedimentary rock layers. Sedimentary rock layers are form by heat/pressure on sediments. Sediments can be sand or dust or other rocks or dirt, just like debris basically. \n  So debris builds up over time, the weight/pressure of it forms rock layers, those rock layers show earth timeline. \nAnd we don\'t have to worry about running out of sand/dirt because volcanos and the like make us more rocks everyday (yay lava/magma)', 103, 'dpdd8qc', '41'),
(4536, 'The surface of the earth is constantly experiencing erosion and sedimentation.\n\nErosion is when rocks are broken down into smaller pieces and washed away. Sedimentation is when those pieces come to rest in a new location and eventually form new rock. Erosion and sedimentation happen because water, wind, and ice are constantly moving across the Earth\'s surface and acting upon the rock. The planet as a whole is not getting bigger, it\'s just that material is being moved from place to place.', 103, 'dpdi8i6', '9'),
(4537, 'A major concept that many often miss is that the geologic history of Earth as preserved in the rock is episodic and incomplete.

(4538, 'Some good answers here but I\'d like to add some more detail. Generally earth builds up in some areas and not in others, instead being eroded away, removed by rivers, glaciers, rain etc. \n\nGenerally where people lived there tends to be agriculture and vegetation and that often contributes to build up of soil. Modern agricultural practices prevent erosion so they contribute to this process. Rubbish of all sorts also contributes, so in many human settlements the level of the ground can build up higher than surrounding areas. The most extreme examples are the \'tells\' of the near east https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_(archaeology) where towns on flat plains ended up as big hills, entirely made of material left by the inhabitants over centuries. For the same reason, medieval churches in some European towns now have their doorways below street level, because the streets have been slowly rising! Christchurch in Dublin is one example.\n\nWhen you are talking as far back as dinosaurs, the same processes happen but on such a long time scale that massive geological factors are also at play. Some parts of the parts of the earth\'s crust that were land at the time of the dinosaurs have now been pushed up into mountains, down under the sea, folded up in all sorts of distorted patterns. This is due to several different processes, including sedimentation (the build up of soil), plate tectonics (the movement of the earth\'s plates, massive seal-level change and volcanic action. A good illustration are the dinosaur footprints at Cal Orcko https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Orcko\n\nSo sometimes dinosaur bones are very deep, as they are shown in the cartoons, just below the pirate gold and above the ufos but they can be right at the surface or at the top of a mountain, where that mountain used to be lower down or even under the sea. It used to confuse people a lot to find seashells on mountains before this was figured out!\n\nLayers of the earth are laid down in the order they were created, so dinosaurs are way below human material, but sometimes a lot of the upper stuff is removed by erosion', 103, 'dpdi8zy', '7'),

(4540, 'I’m a geologist, admittedly not a sedimentology guy though. I think you’re trying to ask why does some stuff erode away and why does other stuff stack up (like in the case of dinosaurs). \n\nThat is determined by uplift and subsidence. If part of the crust gets pushed up to a greater elevation (like a mountain, for instance) it will slowly, bit by bit be weathered (broken down) and eroded (carried away). This stuff that’s carried away we call sediment and it’s what makes up sedimentary rock. \n\nHow does sedimentary rock get made?  Subsidence. Through rivers (mostly) and wind (less mostly) this sediment will collect in a lower-lying spot like a basin, or out in the ocean. Here’s the key thing - if this place happens to subside, or move down over time, more stuff will get piled on top of it. If you do this long enough and bury enough sediment on top of it, it will become ‘lithified’ into rock. If/when these low spots get uplifted, whether or not they’re rock or just stacked up sediment, they’ll eventually get  weathered and eroded too. \n\nSo wrapping this way too long answer up, dinosaur skeletons and even those that were buried long enough to become fossils both get weathered and eroded all the time. Bunches more are still underground because they haven’t been uplifted and brought to the surface. \n\nSorry for the novel!', 103, 'dpduh5v', '3'),

In human settlements we tended to drag dirt and poo around alot slowly causing streets to rise over centuries to the point where the ground story of buildings slowly begin to sink below ground level.

(4544, 'So first you need to ask is, where does soil come from?\n\nSoil is essentially decomposed biomass, and that biomass came from C02 and N2 gas in the atmosphere that were "fixed" into other solid molecules by plants.\n\nThere\'s an entire procession from lichens that can grow on bare rock and use acid to leech minerals, to nitrogen fixers that can root in poor/young soils and pull their own nitrogen from the air, to  more common plants growing in rich soils and getting their nitrogen from the soil.\n\nVarious environmental conditions dictate how complete the decomposition of biomass is back to gasses is, but it\'s never 100% so you get deposition that way.', 103, 'dpdlbid', '2'),

That is what exposes the bones and allows for excavation.  He also taught me that all of the desert that is now southern Utah looked like Louisiana bayou 70-90 million years ago when most of those dinosaurs were buried in the mud thereby preserving them until modern day. \n\nAccording to him, contrary to popular belief, the Grand Canyon was not carved in by the water but has stayed relatively consistent while the rock wall are pushed up on either side of it.

Over the past few centuries though more historical things would have been demolished knowingly or just covered up by smaller scale weathering in forms such as the ones I described. ', 103, 'dpdmkwz', '1'),
(4548, 'There are a number of geological processes at work: Erosion, deposition, plate movements; that move sediments from one place to another. The easiest to see is sand dunes. Go to the beach and see how the wind changes the shape of the dunes. Sometimes they get piled on, sometimes it gets blown away, and sometimes it\'s the water that moves things around instead of the wind. Think about how easy it is for something to get lost in the sand or how something buried could get exposed. Now think of the sand itself: where did it come from? Why is there so much of it on beaches? If you look at the composition, the sand granules usually match the surrounding mountain regions where the headwaters of things like rivers usually begin. As the water trickles down the mountains they carry along sediments that often eventually find their way to the mouth of the river where it meets the ocean. This is just one example of  how sediments get moved around, but these are very short term processes. Diagenasis and metamorphasis are much more time intensive processes that lithify (turn to rock) sediments. If you look at dinosaurs, they aren\'t in dirt, but embedded in rock. That\'s because the sediments they were originally deposited in have been around so long that they have undergone metamorphosis and turned from a loose sediment into a new lithic structure (metamorphasis also requires heat and pressure).\n\nHave you ever melted crayons? Imagine the crust of the earth as a ball of crayon wax surrounding a heat source (the earths core). If you poke a hole in the surface some of the molten crayon would come out and harden (like a volcano or a crack in the tectonic plates) conversely, you have have deeper parts melt back into the core. This is how new material is \'added\' and \'and taken\' away but really it\'s just a zero sum equation. Anything short of a meteorite landing or the moon getting blown off won\'t add or subtract material from the earth. \n\nSince this is all just moving stuff from one place to another, as one thing gets buried another area is being revealed. This is why the rift valley has been so important to archaeologists: It\'s a valley made by a rip in the plates that exposes sediments that were deposited during a particular time period that is relevant to our human past. The burial and lithification preserved it, but if it were never exposed by the rift we might have never known it was there.', 103, 'dpdqnh5', '1'),

Contrary to popular belief, **making up for "sleep debt" doesn\'t really exist**. \n\n[In a 2014 paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience by Dr Jing Zhang](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4418.short), it was shown that in short durations of sleep deprivation, a protective molecule called SirT3:\n\n> coordinates mitochondrial energy production and redox homeostasis. We find that brief wakefulness upregulates SirT3 and antioxidants in LCns, protecting metabolic homeostasis.\n\nThis means that SirT3 protects your brain from the bad parts of metabolism. "Redox" is short for "reduction oxidation" which means that you are changing the charge on an atom/ion. One of the most common ones that causes damage to the body is reactive oxygen species (ROS). You can think of it like an exhaust pipe in a car. When burning fuel to make the car run, you\'ll end up producing some unwanted products. Antioxidants are healthy to consume so that you can neutralize these ROS. SirT3 acts in a protective fashion against redox byproducts\n\nFor the first time, it was shown that, while SirT3 is able to sufficiently protect the brain after short durations of extended wakefullness (like pulling an all nighter), it is unable to keep up with chronic (many days) of sleep deprivation. There simply isn\'t enough of it. This causes damage to the neurons, which kill themselves through apoptosis (programed cell death). Neurons (brain cells) are considered to be one of the few areas of the body which cannot regenerate like the other areas (heart and skeletal muscle being the others). \n\nBecause the cells started getting damaged permanently, "making up for sleep on the weekend" doesn\'t help bring back those cells. **This paper is significant because, for the first time, it was shown that sleep deprivation can have permanent negative effects on the brain.** \n\n[This is a Huff Post article which explains it in simpler language](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-michael-j-breus/sleep-brain-health_b_5508930.html)\n\nEdit: added another line\n\nEdit 2: I should also add that my qualifications on this topic are not great.

There, Clovis people and their descendants hunted large game and spread rapidly through the New World. Twentieth-century discoveries of distinctive Clovis artifacts throughout North America, some associated with mammoth or mastodon kill sites, supported this “Clovis-first” model. North America\'s coastlines and their rich marine, estuarine, riverine, and terrestrial ecosystems were peripheral to the story of how and when the Americas were first settled by humans. Recent work along the Pacific coastlines of North and South America has revealed that these environments were settled early and continuously provided a rich diversity of subsistence options and technological resources for New World hunter-gatherers.\n\n', 125, 'dpdf034', '116'),

Better truncate it above some finite radius.\n- if a<-2 the total charge is finite and it actually has to be zero (because the flux through a very large sphere goes to zero). This means that the charge density must actually have opposite sign to the total charge in a radius... very counterintuitive. At r=0 there must be an infinite point charge with the other sign to counteract the diverging charge density! There\'s some rudimentary renormalization to do here. Either that, or truncate *below* a certain radius.\n\nEDIT: now for a truly remarkable fact. If x+y=1, then the cases a=x and a=y are actually related by a duality which is simply given by spherical inversion, aka the method of images for spherical conductors.

We were just hanging out, having a pretty nice time for over an hour, and he suggested we go out partying and stuff and he said he would just run to the corner store and get beers and smokes since we were still eating, so we gave him $20 and he said he\'d be right back. We waited for like 20 minutes and we\'re like obviously he\'s not coming back. It was hard to believe, really. He put in so much effort, and scammed us out of like $25 in total.

Maybe a way to express petty revenge because the first draft sequence of wheat was published in Science journal and not Nature? That brings me to my main point: Several versions of the wheat genome have already been published with the first major and clean one in [2014 by a international consortium of scientists] (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6194/1251788). The same group is almost ready to publish a much better version sometime this year but have allowed scientists like myself access to the latest sequences for our work. Then a group of [UK scientists published in 2015] (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0582-8). This new publication is just another brick in the wall. I actually love these independent efforts because one day, all the data generated will help us get a really polished final version of the genome, ala the human genome sequencing efforts. But no matter how many groups sequence it, the consortium version will most likely be of the highest quality because they are separating each chromosome from the rest and sequencing one at a time. But yeah, the whole \'scooped\' thing is utter nonsense.\n\nI must also point out that for what this study claims to be accomplishing, they failed to report sequences for each chromosome separately... unless I failed to see it (I\'m on mobile). A reference sequence is no good without chromosomal assignment of  the sequences. All they report are contigs (long stretches of contiguous sequences) so this data is pretty useless for me and most researchers in its current form.

Multiple past attempts to assemble the genome have produced assemblies that were well short of the estimated genome size. Here we report the first near-complete assembly of T. aestivum, using deep sequencing coverage from a combination of short Illumina reads and very long Pacific Biosciences reads. The final assembly contains 15,344,693,583 bases and has a weighted average (N50) contig size of 232,659 bases. This represents by far the most complete and contiguous assembly of the wheat genome to date, providing a strong foundation for future genetic studies of this important food crop. We also report how we used the recently published genome of Aegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, to identify 4,179,762,575 bp of T. aestivum that correspond to its D genome components.', 149, 'dpd1nr1', '23'),

That is a difficult thing to measure in a non-invasive way, as it is not generally considered ethical (or even remotely practical) to implant billions of tiny electrodes in people\'s brains. MRIs can show aggregate activity, but measuring 100 billion neurons at 0.00000000023 watts each is beyond their capabilities (to my knowledge.)\n\nWith so many neurons involved, and so little power going through each neuron, I don\'t consider it very likely that strong electromagnetic waves would emanate in a cohesive way.\n\nI would be interested in hearing the opinion of someone with more specific knowledge.

I will just expose one example: Relation between Sleep and one type of dementia.\n\nIt is known for some years that the glymphatic system is like a lymphatic system in our brain. It allows to remove waste products, metabolites and some peptides from the brain, in order to be cleared. An important example is the Abeta peptide, a well-known peptide which is one of the causes of Alzheimer\'s disease (the most proeminent dementia). This peptide is cleared by this pathway (existing other pathways). Interestingly, it was observed that this pathway is mainly active during the sleep. Thus, we can easily see a relation between sleep <-> Abeta deposition <-> dementia. If you have a low amount of sleep, this system will barely work and the amount of abeta cleared is decreased. So, it will accumulate and generate its negative effects.\n\nOf course this is a really specific example, and several things are involved, as the amount of time you sleep, age, genetics etc. It is important to understand that these experiments were performed in mice, so it this relation can be a bit complex in humans.\n\nthe glymphatic system:\nhttp://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/147/147ra111.full\n\nReview on the glymphatic system:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636982/\n\nI dont\' know if I explained me in a good way, but I just wanted to give my small contribution.', 114, 'dpehv39', '2'),

(7436, 'Okay shit, I actually wanted to find a thread where I could pull a Lochness Monster comment, but I really did have a crazy neighbor back about 8-10 years ago.\n\nThere was a mentally ill woman, probably in her 50\'s or early 60\'s, named Charlene that lived in the apartment next to mine in a gated community. Initially, while I was moving stuff in with my cousins, she greeted me, and seemed pleasant enough. A bit strange, but more just like a lonely older lady. She told me it would be nice to have such a nice looking young man moving in next to her, said something about looking like Tom Cruise, and I believe offered to make something sweet one day.\n\nI thought nothing of it, and went about my business. She would always sit at her window at the front of her apartment, which looked into a courtyard our part of the complex would all pass through going to our cars, or back to our apartments.\n\nIt happened over the course of 4 months maybe, and began with her banging on her wall (which I believe was her living area) that connected to my bedroom. I thought that maybe at some point I had music too loud (though I always kept my bass off, and thought I was mindful enough of it) so I just shrugged it off.\n\nWhen my mother came to visit a few times, and when I would come back from university, or head out in the mornings, Charlene began yelling obscene things from her window. A lot were at me or my mother, but sometimes she would yell at other people walking past, or a parent pushing a child in the stroller. She would call me a bastard, my mother a harlot, tell other people to "fuck right off," call some heathens, just random batshit behavior.\n\nBy this point I was rolling my eyes, thinking, "Great, I have to hear this crazy lady and feel her burning a hole through me every time I leave or come home."\n\nGirlfriend stayed at my place a lot, days at a time, and we would fuck. Got loud at times, and Charlene would bang on the wall and we would hear her yelling things through it. "Okay," I thought, "Just keep it quieter so we don\'t have to deal with her nonsense."\n\nOnly that didn\'t help.\n\nAt this point, I had been there a few months, and Charlene began to get worse. She would bang on the wall with no provocation, any time of day or night. I would be studying quietly, sleeping, sometimes not even home - still, she would slam on it multiple times. I knew she would do it when I wasn\'t home because if my mother spent the night in another room, or my girlfriend stayed while I was at class, they would hear it.\n\nEventually I called the police to file a complaint, let them know what was happening. It turned out they knew Charlene well, as did others in the apartment complex. She would frequently walk up and down the streets outside the gated community with a black trash bag, and do all random things in the neighborhood, mainly yelling at people, and loitering places until someone called to have her removed. The area I lived in was fairly shady to begin with, so she fit right in.\n\nWhen the police spoke with her, she started telling them how my mother was "Heather Locklear" (I guess she looks like that, wasn\'t too far off), and that she would have sex with police officers on top of the cruisers. Also, she insisted that I would get drunk and hide in her (Charlene\'s) closet.\n\nUpon having this nonsense relayed to me, I realized just how crazy this lady was. I\'m trying to think of other stories she made up, I\'ll edit if/when they come to me. There were a lot of weird tales she conjured up, but the funniest to me was that I would somehow conjure into being in *her* closet and get drunk.\n\nThe police couldn\'t do anything at this point, nor any of the other times I (and other neighbors) called to complain about her behavior, because she was mentally competent enough not to be committed to a facility, and never did anything violent. That last part stuck with me, because I knew what it would have to come to in order to get rid of her.\n\nTo truncate the story here (as I\'m not sure how interesting this is), things culminated when I was exhausted from being awake for two days studying, working in a research lab on campus, and trying to finally get some rest one afternoon, maybe around 3 PM. She banged on the wall (it had been a semi-regular thing at this point, so I\'d usually ignore it) but louder than usual, waited maybe five minutes, and then did it again, louder, and more frequently.\n\nI snapped at this point, went to my computer, put the volume 3/4 the way up, bass to full (had a fairly large subwoofer at this point) and played the second half of a sine sweep file, and looped it. It shook the entire complex, sounded like a combination of a low-flying plane and a having a train track in your backyard. Along with this, I slammed on the wall for the better part of two minutes. I knew that if anything could push this crazy lady enough, this should be it.\n\nIt did.\n\nShe came to the back door, which was a screen, and sliding glass, screaming, raving, and brandishing a broomstick. I yelled some things about her being a fucking lunatic, and she started slamming the broomstick at the screen, eventually breaking it. My mother was visiting at this time, and she was yelling in the background too, telling me not to agitate her, because she was afraid of what the lady might do.\n\nOther neighbors heard/saw this, and I called the police. They came, we told them what happened, and how it escalated, and one officer wound up climbing through her living room window in order to apprehend her. They saw the damage to the screen, the neighbors corroborated, and eventually Charlene was taken into custody and committed to an institution, while I was offered an order of protection.\n\nA bunch of people in the apartment complex, many of them parents with young kids who would play in the courtyard, were all very celebratory and thanked me for having pushed things far enough to make something happen - everyone wanted Charlene gone.\n\nApparently she had very, very rich family who would pay for her to live there, which is how the managed to stay free and around everybody all those years, without getting taken away.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nCrazy lady living next door to me in apartment complex screamed, raved, and pounded on adjacent walls, convinced that my mother was Heather Locklear and that she had sex with cops on top of the police vehicles, and that I got drunk and hid in her closet.\n\nLady came to back door to attack me with broomstick, broke the screen, eventually got taken away by police and committed to mental institution.', 158, 'dpef2pi', '3'),

Many times, she would share very personal stories from her young life, some of them quite disturbing, and the kind of thing that most people would only share with someone they had known for decades, not a next door neighbor.\n\nToward the end of her time living there, there was a couple who came for a "visit," which most people would take to mean a weekend, particularly when they were visiting someone who lives in a one room apartment, but they stayed for months.  It became obvious that they were living off her.  She was on disability for various physical ailments and had very limited resources, yet nonetheless the male in this couple, an extremely able-bodied man in his late 30\'s or early 40\'s would expect her to provide him cigarette money.  She eventually moved to a rent-subsidized place and they moved with her!  She would invite me to her new place, and talk to me about how she might lose that place because she wasn\'t allowed such "long term guests."  I nudged her toward cutting off this guy\'s cigarette money and that even if he couldn\'t find a job, he could at least sell his plasma for such things.  The couple eventually decided they would move back to the city they came from and get jobs, and I fronted them the tickets for a Megabus ride to that city.

My husband was going to sign up but due to chronic medical issues couldn\'t enlist, so I did. \n\nSo I spent my daughter\'s first Christmas at Navy boot camp.  They drill instructors let us spend the day at a USO that was on base, watching football and eating junk food and someone brought gifts for everyone which turned out to be socks for the men and a tiny sample of perfume for the women. They had 3 payphones people could use, and there was such a long line that they mandated only 3 minutes.  My husband had long since had the phone turned off bc couldn\'t afford it, so I had no way to talk to him. We had exchanged letters and he told me he would spend the day with his family and I could reach him by phone there. I waited well over two hours in the phone line and by the time it was my turn, husband had given up waiting for me to call and had gone back to our house.  His dad told me I just missed  him, and sent a family member out to chase him down but he was gone.  I remember being so sad and alone that I went somewhere and cried. \n\nJust typing this reminds me of how lonely I was. Boot camp is no place to be at Christmas. My company commander found out that I had left a 3 month old baby at home and told me I needed my head examined; I told him that I had no way to pay rent or diapers without being in the Navy and he cut me some slack after that.

They\'re both indoor cats so it was very important to not accidentally let them outside because my grandparents live out in the middle of nowhere. Like, dirt roads and dark Swedish forests nowhere. You can probably see where this is going.\n\n\nThe evening of December 23rd, we\'re all getting ready for bed and my grandma is making the cats a quick snack but only one of them shows up. It\'s a pretty big house so we figure her sister is probably just off somewhere and we decide to just go to bed. By noon on Christmas eve no one\'s seen her, she didn\'t even show up for breakfast. My grandpa remembered that he might have left the front door open for just a minute when he went to get the mail the day before and we all panic. All three of us spend most of the day looking for her, both outside and inside, to no avail. My grandpa felt super guily and went so far as to visit all of the nearest neighbors, which took him almost two hours. Bear in mind, Christmas Eve is when Swedes actually celebrate Christmas, not on Christmas day like most others, so this years celebration effectively turned into a wake. The entire day I was either out looking for my cat, or inside trying not to cry like a baby. Christmas Eve came and went without us finding her.\n\n\nThere\'s a happy ending though. In the middle of the night, probably around two a.m, I get up to go to the bathroom. When I turn on the light I can see my missing cat sitting on the edge of my bed, casually licking her paw as if she hadn\'t been missing for about 30 hours! My grandma wakes up from hearing me crying and sniffling and comes to check on me and as soon as she sees the little furball, she starts crying too, and then immediately goes to fix up some cat food.\n\n\nSo, where had she been? Well, I realized that my suitcase, which I had propped up against the bed, was slightly open. I checked inside and sure enough, all of my clothes had been shifted into a pile and there was a fine layer of white cat hair on them. My cat is the kind who, if you put her in a box or something similar and close the lid, won\'t try to get out or even make a sound, unless there is like a tiny slit for her to poke her face through. The little furball spent thirty hours in that suitcase, ignoring her own hunger and our cries for her before she finally figured out where the opening was! Since then, I no longer bring my cats with me to visit for Christmas. Either I find a cat-sitter or I\'ll just turn it into a day-trip.\n\n\nI realize this is in no way a tragedy compared to what most others in this thread went through but my cats helped me through a long period of depression and they\'re the reason I\'m even alive today. That feeling I had the entirety of Christmas Eve, where it felt like I\'d never see my beloved cat again, like I would never feel happy again, was the worst.', 163, 'dped2ix', '3'),

It was around that time that my dad got called out to an accident just outside of town.

The impact killed both parents and one of the kids, the two surviving siblings were in rough shape and were rushed to city hospitals via helicopter. My dad said one wasn’t likely to survive, and if she did, she wouldn’t be able to function the same due to head trauma and the other one would likely never walk again. The momentum of the impact of the crash to the side of the vehicle swung all of the passengers’ legs so hard that they broke it several places and it was almost impossible to stabilize the legs. The couple in the other car had good winter tires and were able to stop fairly quickly after impact and left unharmed save for a couple cuts and bruises.

I\'ve never got him to howl but apparently his jam is the screaming of a dying rabbit. Not even a good hunter! He cant smell worth a shit since his snout is only about an inch long but when my chickens are out, he goes and stands next to them, head low, one paw up like he\'s pointing, he shakes and then the hen pecks him and he peels the fuck outta ~~doge~~ dodge (sorrynotsorry). He eats bugs. I tag team my dogs on flies. Ivy catches then spits out and this motherfucker swoops in and EATS it. Sometimes he plays with it. Often he tries to get on the couch with it. He cant growl or bristle right. First time I heard him I nearly wet myself laughing so hard. When he bristles, he just has a butt mohawk & only one section of his thin tail can puff up. Looks like a snake swallowed a golfball. God forbid the "threat" come at him bro...he gone!\n\nThen there\'s Ivy the blue heeler. Fucking fat ass. I tap my foot twice where I spilled something and as long as she hears it, she comes running so Tobi cant eat it. I say clean up and its the same as a foot tap. Will not get the hell out the way when I\'m cooking because she knows if I trip on her, I\'ll drop something and she can get snacks. She wont use the bathroom on a leash, she starts fights like some hot thing with dogs and goes crazy for any animal but shits herself if I actually put one near her (ie a chick, dead game, grasshopper, a bee), she doesnt play with toys but if she sees Tobi going for one, she suddenly wants it. She sleeps on her back. One of her ears are floppy. She has a golden ass.

After we moved (dog since passed), he decided he had to live in my bedroom more, including his food. Then he again got worse and could only eat/drink if it wasn\'t on the floor. He now has his own little side table next to my bed with his food and water.\n\nHe also stress eats, literally. If my sister comes over or our new dog barks, he\'ll run to his bowl (taking after his mommy - me lol). Marley has a sorta weak stomach as well, so good amount of the time it turns into throw up.\n\nAs I mentioned, he\'s terrified of my sister (sometimes he\'s okay for some reason) even though she adopted him. We\'re 90% sure he has anxiety because my sister accidentally \'hot boxed\' him while he was in her room, he\'s named after Bob Marley, which is hilarious.\n\nHe also likes to sleep under blankets, in 90 degree weather.. He\'s almost had heatstroke before and continues to do this.\n\nMy favorite quirk though is he senses my depression (why we think he chose me) and has continued, over his 9 years of life, while battling to stay alive (so many medical issues), to honor his commitment to stay with me for *his* forever. This includes: laying on me constantly, cuddling on top of the hip where I use to self harm and leaving a window \'randomly\' moments before I cut into my stomach. He refused to get off of me until I put the blade away.\n\nIn our first house, he slept during the day and would stay up all night so he could \'guard the door\' (bathroom was next to my room). Entire family has caught him staring at them multiple times, he still does this sometimes in our new home.\n\nIt\'s really funny that even with his anxiety and trust issues, he *immediately* fell in love with my boyfriend. He cuddles and come out of his hiding whenever he comes over. I\'ve noticed that ever since I met my boyfriend and stopped self harm (he\'s the reason I stopped), Marley has slowly become his age and actually rests now. \n\nI think he\'s realized I\'m okay now and that I have someone to take care of me, making him \'pass the baton\' so to speak.

These data are crucial to understanding recent variability and changes in Arctic sea ice. Sea ice thickness retrievals at the CryoSat-2 frequency require accurate measurements of sea ice freeboard, assumed to be attainable when the main radar scattering horizon is at the snow/sea ice interface. Using an extensive snow thermophysical property dataset from late winter conditions in the Canadian Arctic, we examine the role of saline snow on first-year sea ice (FYI), with respect to its effect on the location of the main radar scattering horizon, its ability to decrease radar penetration depth, and its impact on FYI thickness estimates. Based on the dielectric properties of saline snow commonly found on FYI, we quantify the vertical shift in the main scattering horizon. This is found to be approximately 0.07 m. We propose a thickness-dependent snow salinity correction factor for FYI freeboard estimates. This significantly reduces CryoSat-2 FYI retrieval error. Relative error reductions of ~11% are found for an ice thickness of 0.95 m and ~25% for 0.7 m. Our method also helps to close the uncertainty gap between SMOS and CryoSat-2 thin ice thickness retrievals. Our results indicate that snow salinity should be considered for FYI freeboard estimates.\n___\n\n[Figure](http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/2017/11/Figure4.png): This schematic illustrates how salinity shifts the source of the radar signature in the icepack.

Many of my most valuable lessons have come only recently, through books and exchanges online. I think that seeing the big picture challenges some aspies, and that parents can offer help towards understanding it. \n\n**Explain WHY people do things.** Humans, especially NT\'s, are good at following the behaviors and patterns of other humans, even when the behaviors don\'t make much sense in the moment. Much of socializing comprises simply mirroring the expression, style or demeanor of surrounding people.

I tend to narrow my focus to a myopic and irrelevant corner, and would have appreciated a few gentle hints about the bigger picture. \n\n**Review what happened, to reinforce lessons.** Consider what happened during the day, week, month or year. Experience happens fast, and lacks a label to signify its importance or relevance. If your kid steps out of line, use it as an opportunity. Later in the week. gently ask them to think of what they learned. If something good or unusual happens, talk about it more than once after they\'ve had a chance to reflect on it. Make this a habit of reviewing and reflecting on the recent past, so that your questions don\'t sound like harassment over mistakes. \n\n**Share what you do.** Growing up, I felt like adults traveled daily to some mystical faraway land called “work” where the rules had changed entirely and nothing of what I knew would apply. Please don\'t perpetuate this illusion. Share examples of problems you solved during the day, and how, with a little practice, your kids could also solve them. ', 186, 'dpdyemm', '43'),
(10087, 'I\'m on the high-functioning end of the spectrum and first got treatment/therapy when I was an adult. As such I\'ve spent a bit of time thinking about this kind of thing and here is a small dump of some of it.\n\n---\n\nThe most prominent problem for me personally is/was dealing with emotions. There\'s a common and moronic notion that people with autism lack some emotions and that is plain false. However, the brain appears to have some trouble identifying and internalizing emotions and that is something that children/teenagers in particular need help with.\n\nThe way it was phrased to me by a psychologist was that, ideally, parents of young autism-spectrum children should not ask them how they\'re feeling but should instead *tell* them how they feel. This should help the child identify their own emotions and supply a vocabulary to talk and think about emotions. For me personally I still have severe trouble actually talking about emotions, to a large part because of missing vocabulary.\n\n---\n\nTo extend the above, my observation of it is that a central part of autism is that anything "outside" the self is perceived as uncertain/dangerous/frightening. And since emotions aren\'t properly internalized they tend to be perceived as "outside" factors and not part of the self. They\'re a foreign influence to be avoided and fought against, and this is not a good situation to be in.\n\nA psycologist could probably phrase it better/more accurately, but I\'ve been told that this is fairly typical.\n\n---\n\nAs other answers have mentioned, treat children as normal to the extent it\'s possible. One thing my parents appear to have done right is to force me to go outside and socialize even if I just like staying in my room. Talking, interacting and socializing are skills and can be learned and trained.\n\n---\n\nA point related to the above one: silent children need more attention than loud ones. This is a paraphrased general suggestion and not a rule, but the point is that children who are content with staying silent and on their own are generally overlooked in favour of the louder children who request/demand attention. To add a personal observation again, I still really don\'t like any attention and will avoid asking for it, but that is not the same as not *needing* it.\n\n---\n\nFind a good psychologist (or psychotherapist I guess, they\'re different but I don\'t keep track). This is easier said than done it seems but can make such a huge difference. As for what "good" means, I can give two of my own observations/opinions:\n\n1) A good psychologist is not coddling. If you are paying for an hour of being reassured then that might feel better for the moment but will help with absolutely nothing and is a waste of time and money. That\'s not to say a psychologist should be abrasive/aggressive/whatever but if you\'re actually there to get help with some issue then that issue should be properly addressed even if it is uncomfortable (perhaps especially then).\n\n2) A good psychologist is observant. I have a hard time putting this one into words, but what I\'m trying to get at is that if they only ask questions and need to be told everything, it is probably not that helpful. When I met my current psychologist it took her all of five seconds to note my issues with eye-contact and start probing. The next 90 minutes were somewhat surreal and I\'m sure that by the end she could describe me far better than I could myself.\n\n---\n\nFollow-up: listen to the psychologist. If you don\'t trust him/her then what\'s the point, and if you do then she/he should be in a better position to know a good course of action. This is, I think, mostly relevant to more severe autism that can\'t really be handled like a "normal child with some oddities".\n\n---\n\nI\'ve heard good things about dogs. I\'m a cat-person myself and have no experience with dogs but I understand there are service-type dogs or dogs in general that can help quite a lot. In any case, animals can be a lot easier to connect with since they\'re less complicated than other people.\n\n---\n---\n\nThis is my first time sharing these thoughts and I would be happy to receive comments, even if it\'s scary :)\n', 186, 'dpdzea5', '13'),
